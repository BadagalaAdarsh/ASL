* This is a VGG16 based CNN model which classifies 29 different classes which includes 26 alphabets, Space, Nothing and Delete symbols
* It was trained on nearly 87,000 images ( approximately 3000 images for each class )
* This data set is taken from kaggle
* Due to very high number of images I have used ImageDataGenerator so that images can be given to model at runtime
* Given the favourable conditions like Good lighting condition the model is able to predict all the classes fairly accurate
